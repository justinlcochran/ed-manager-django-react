Flexible mode or Strict mode (can be set by admin??) ((Starting with strict mode only))

Render a question input field:

Know-Show on the left (checkbox for flexible, Selected chronologically for strict), Question box and Answer boxes below (autocheck radio1??)

Submit button with onClick: Save completed question to state [{}], this will update the rendered but invisible map of question drafts (edit button?), then create a new question field below, tick up question number

When all knowRequired in knowSatisfied, contextual SUBMIT ASSESSMENT button appears ({knowShowRequired == knowShowSatisfied && Submit Button})

Actual submit, backend receives objects as array of question objects containing answer objects. Unpack each, instantiate in backend, then display "What's next?" links
